# C++-projects
Here are some of my self-made C++ projects. I hope you find them helpful.
1) The First project is a Contact Book App, which provides storing, creating, searching, and deleting contacts from a text file; the  text file is used just for the sake of simplicity because it is my first project.
2) The Second Project is a simulation of gravity, and we have used Newton's law of gravitation and equations of motion for this project. For visualization, we used OpenGL. We have tested it with 5 bodies, one at the center acting as the sun, and four other objects revolving around it, like planets.
